1.81E+16,2023-08-22T11:23:17+0000,"Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)- what is it and how long does it (realistically) take to get pregnant? 

IUI is a procedure where a semen sample is collected and washed so that sperm is concentrated into a small volume which is then injected at the top of the uterus. From here, a high concentration of forward moving sperm enter the tubes on either side and (hopefully) interact with the egg(s). 

Whether doing IUI with your own ovulation or with an added boost from medications to potentially release more than one egg- IUI success rates aren’t so much higher than trying on your own with timed intercourse. IUIs are often used when conceiving using donor sperm. They can also provide an added edge when the sperm concentration or motility are a little lower than where we like to see, if there is sexual dysfunction and it’s hard to get sperm into the reproductive tract by having sex, or in unexplained infertility when we don’t know why it isn’t happening so maybe adding it in could help address some hidden factor. 

Because success rates tend to be anywhere from 5-15 (max 20%) each cycle, depending on the cycle/individual, it most often takes multiple IUIs to get pregnant. If you are choosing this as an option, get your head in the game that you may need 3-4 cycles at a minimum to realize a benefit. In couples with unexplained infertility, studies show cumulative success starts to level out and there are diminishing returns when you approach a 6th failed medicated IUI cycle. At this point, we usually call it and recommend moving onto IVF if possible. It is never wrong to switch from IUI to IVF earlier than the 6th cycle. But if you are motivated and want to see this method through- give it time. IUI may be less burdensome than IVF in some ways but it can certainly be a marathon- so mentally prepare for multiple cycles… and if it works earlier than expected, great- all you need is one ✨LUCKY ✨egg to meet the right sperm 💜

Have you done IUIs? What was your experience?

1.80E+16,2023-08-22T22:25:53+0000,"I get asked this question all the time! 

IUI can be a great treatment option/first step- but one should never stay on the IUI path indefinitely without thinking about the big picture. Watch this video to learn my top 5 examples of reasons to consider moving on from IUI to IVF. 

Every case is different and every patient is an individual with their own goals and story. Here are 5 general reasons that I may encourage my patients to consider moving on from IUI to IVF. 

Please note that these are *NOT* rules or medical advice for you- but general thoughts I have re: the things to consider. It is important to be strategic with your treatment path as time = egg quantity and quality (which are both important for IVF efficiency and success! 

Not everyone who does IVF is successful and it’s not an easy or quick fix, and yes it is not always feasible or covered by insurance- and sometimes insurance will dictate how many IUIs you have to do before they will cover IVF. These are all real issues that have to be considered as well. 

Despite not being able to address these nuances, I hope this video is helpful in making people think critically about their strategy and if and when to pivot.

1.79E+16,2023-08-23T13:47:30+0000,"Had to jump on this trend! But honestly - it is SO TRUE. We have to set the foundation of feeling proud of our bodies and not ashamed of our biology (ie. periods and all of the mental and physical changes and monthly signs and symptoms they come with!)

I talk to my 3 and 6 year old about periods. I let the convo come up organically. I use correct anatomical terms. I teach them about physical boundaries and to share their questions openly. Maybe they don’t understand all there is to know about ovulation and why periods happen (yet!) but the concept has been introduced early and will be discussed much more in years to come. 

As a fertility doctor, I believe it’s crucial to engage children early in conversations about reproductive health and periods. By discussing these topics openly and age-appropriately, we empower kids with accurate information, fostering a healthy understanding of their bodies. This knowledge encourages responsible decision-making and helps prevent misinformation. 

Early conversations also reduce stigma and anxiety around reproductive health matters, ensuring that kids grow up with confidence and respect for their bodies. 

Furthermore, addressing these subjects early can potentially identify any health concerns or irregularities sooner, allowing for timely intervention if needed. 

All too often, young women are labeled as “crazy” or “dramatic” or as “complainers” when they talk about their periods and the things they experience on a monthly basis. We need to normalize these convos so that people don’t feel gaslit by doctors, society, their partners etc. 

Overall, open discussions promote a positive attitude towards reproductive health and empower people  to take charge of their well-being later in life.

1.80E+16,2023-08-25T21:19:53+0000,"Many of the patients I diagnose with PCOS on a daily basis, do NOT fit the ‘traditional’ mold when you think about the textbook picture associated with PCOS (which typically involves weight gain, especially abdominal, excess hair growth etc). 

PCOS is basically a communication issue - the brain is sending messages to the ovary but the ovary is resistant. Also the cells of the body are often resistant to insulin (which stores sugars). This leads to high insulin levels that can stimulate the ovary to make testosterone- which can further interfere with the signals from the brain to the ovary (worsening irregular cycles) and also cause acne and male-pattern hair growth. 

Weight gain can happen- this ties into the metabolic component of PCOS. However weight gain is NOT part of the diagnosis. You can be lean, normal weight, or even underweight and still have PCOS. 

There’s lots of confusion about the criteria for PCOS -but it actually doesn’t take much to be ruled in for the diagnosis (2 out of 3 of the following is enough: polycystic ovaries (crowded follicles), irregular cycles, symptoms or blood work suggestive of high androgen activity (testosterone)).

If someone is overweight and has PCOS and irregular cycles, losing weight can reduce insulin resistance and restore cycle regularity. 

While women with  lean PCOS do not need to lose weight or be restricted with their food consumption, they can still benefit from lifestyle changes and certain nutritional patterns. Even lean PCOS is associated with insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation. This is why the Mediterranean diet (which is antioxidant rich) is thought to help with inflammatory status, insulin resistance, and high androgens (like testosterone).  

Regular exercise and healthy lifestyle/diet (and drugs like metformin) can be helpful to reduce the symptoms (irregular cycles, acne, hair growth) in lean PCOS. 

If not TTC, acne/ hair growth may benefit from birth control (which lowers free testosterone activity), spironolactone (which lowers testosterone) + metformin (which lowers insulin levels, which in turns lowers ovarian testosterone production).

1.80E+16,2023-08-27T22:35:37+0000,"Confession: I find watching those joint cracking videos oddly satisfying (and the algorithm knows it LOL)— perhaps because I have a chronic knuckle cracking habit! 

I have been asked about whether chiropractic adjustments can help with fertility and the answer is NO. 

There is a complete lack of scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment for infertility. Chiropractic care primarily focuses on the musculoskeletal system, particularly the spine, and claims to promote overall health by ensuring proper spinal alignment and nervous system function.

Infertility, on the other hand, can have various causes ranging from hormonal imbalances to structural issues within the reproductive organs. Chiropractic treatments are not considered a mainstream, primary approach for addressing infertility.

While some proponents of chiropractic care might claim that spinal adjustments can help improve reproductive function by ensuring optimal nerve flow and blood circulation to the reproductive organs, these claims are often anecdotal and lack robust scientific support. Research in this area is limited, and there is a lack of well-designed clinical studies to prove there is any link between chiropractic care and improved fertility outcomes.

Having said that, if you enjoy the feeling of your joints popping and find it relaxing - perhaps there could be some indirect benefit via stress relief/relaxation/placebo effect. I would caution against any manipulation of the thoracic-abdominal area of the body while pregnant and/or undergoing ovarian stimulation (as the ovaries are at risk of torsion due to becoming enlarged). And I would NEVER recommend *relying* on a chiropractic methods for the treatment of infertility- talk to your OBGYN and/or a board certified Reproductive Endocrinologist & Infertility specialist.

1.81E+16,2023-08-29T02:41:00+0000,"As a follow up to my last post on PCOS- here are some quick facts you should know! 

Whether #ttc or not it is important to know that there are ways to address the signs and symptoms of PCOS.

Irregular cycles/ovulation can be treated directly with medications such as letrozole (or clomid/gonadotropins). If treating- I recommend making sure everything else is in “working order” aka total motile sperm count >10 million, unblocked tube(s), normal uterine cavity etc. to make sure it makes sense - and that IVF is not the better plan. 

Reducing insulin resistance can help with fertility and also general health. This can be achieved with weightloss, lifestyle (diet and exercise), and drugs like metformin, supplements such as inositol (weak evidence). 

Quality of life issues like acne and hirsutism (excess hair growth) can be treated with targeted therapies (oral birth control pills, anti androgen therapies such as spironolactone, topical antibiotics, laser/electrolysis etc. 

An important PSA is to make sure you don’t allow an unhealthy buildup of uterine lining that doesn’t get shed for >90 days a time (it is important to balance the lining with progesterone either from ovulation or from supplementation)- otherwise, these built up uterine lining cells can transform to precancer or cancerous cells. An easy way to “protect” the lining is to use birth control pills that contain progesterone, a progestin IUD, or taking cyclic progesterone to shed the lining. 

Did you know women with PCOS are more people to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression? 

There are many aspects about PCOS to manage- find an expert who can help you focus on ALL areas to improve your quality of life and overall health.

1.79E+16,2023-08-29T09:59:22+0000,"My actual reaction to a clip from my current favorite reality show @rhonybravo where America’s favorite couple @jesseltaank and her husband Pavit debate whether family members should know they needed the help of IVF to conceive their twins. I love that they are talking about the issue of IVF and how to share with family etc… But this one part was where he was saying their entire family assumed their kids were “natural” 😒😑— I cannot staaaaand when I hear ppl say that! I was relieved to hear Jessel correct him 😌

Can’t a fertility doctor just come home and unwind in front of the tv after a long day?!? 🤣🤪

Newsflash: nobody can tell if your baby was born from IVF, IUI, or without treatment…the same way they can’t tell if the baby was born vaginally or via c-section! 

Let’s please stop saying: “conceived naturally” or “delivered naturally”!!! 💜

When it comes to reproductive health, I’ve removed the word “natural” from my vocabulary and you should too. 

There is no such thing as a natural conception, a natural delivery, a natural family…

Nature is complex. There’s more than one way to have a baby and create a family. Period. 

When it comes to talking about conceiving, I suggest “unassisted” as an alternative. 

Please share and save ✨and stay tuned for more @rhonybravo content because this week’s episode was … a lot! 🥚✨⚡️❄️👶🏽👶🏽

1.80E+16,2023-08-29T20:04:29+0000,"Quintuplet headlines are not success stories. Yes it seems miraculous to go from having no kids to 5 kids overnight - but twin and especially higher order multiple pregnancies are never the goal of fertility treatment- they are actually viewed as a risk/complication. 

Nowadays, the risk of having twins, and especially triplets or even higher order pregnancies, is significantly lower from fertility treatment thanks to many clinics being able to adapt a Single Embryo Transfer (SET) approach (due to improved IVF success rates). Embryos can split 2-3% of the time (a not so common occurrence). Another mechanism for twins is using medication to induce ovulation (with timed intercourse or IUI)- if using oral meds like clomid or letrozole the risk is lower (3-8% depending on age, # follicles that become mature) … using injectable medications (FSH, menopur etc) can be associated with a much higher risk.

Why is this important?
Multifetal pregnancy has a much higher risk of preterm delivery. As the older sister of a preemie (25 weeker) who needed oxygen therapy for the first 5 years of life (my mom didn’t have twins but went into preterm labor), and as an OBGYN, I am no stranger to the myriad of complications that can arise from being premature: ie. lung under development, vision issues, brain bleeds, neurological issues etc etc. 

This all sounds scary- but know that the risk of these complications can be minimized with careful planning and decision making. This is why I think mid cycle ultrasound monitoring is so important when using medication to induce ovulation + knowing when to cancel a cycle. 
When using donor egg IVF or genetically tested normal embryos, I always recommend a single embryo transfer to lower the risk of twins!
