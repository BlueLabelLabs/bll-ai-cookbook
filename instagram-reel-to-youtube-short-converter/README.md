# Instagram Reel -> YouTube Short Title Generator
This project outlines a simple prompt to an LLM using LangChain that is designed to convert the essay-like captions of a Instagram reel and from them generate short, engaging 40-character or less titles for YouTube Shorts. 

This notebook is part of an automated solution which automatically downloads Instagram reels from a single Instagram user's page, along with the media file and caption (not included in this repository) and then converts this to a YouTube Short which is scheduled for publishing in the future. This notebook demonstrates an important step in this pipeline: creating a title for the YouTube Short which will resonate with the YouTube audience.

The prompts in this notebook are designed to emulate the voice of a Instagram influencer who is a fertility doctor (Reproductive Endocronoligst). The prompts are setup so that it is written from the perspective of authority while also catering to the younger demographic that consumes YouTube Shorts. 

You can find the output of this notebook in production by monitoring the source [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/lucky.sekhon), and the destination [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCid7bqwn9JjcYSJO8jgw0og).
