Some health benefits of birth control: 
1. Pregnancy planning
2. Regulating menstrual cycles
3. Reducing menstrual symptoms, such as cramps, bloating, and mood swings
4. Treating hormonal imbalances, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
5. Improving acne- by balancing hormone levels that contribute to breakouts
6. Lowering the risk of certain cancers, such as ovarian and endometrial cancers

Did you know about all of these?

The bottom line is: the pill does not cause infertility- most hormonal forms work by preventing ovulation (pills, patches) or preventing sperm from reaching the egg (IUD). These are changes which are reversed once the method is discontinued. 

Birth control has many benefits, but know that each individual’s situation and health needs are unique. It’s crucial to consult with your doctor to determine the most suitable birth control method based on personal health, preferences, and lifestyle. Additionally, no birth control method is 100% effective, so it’s essential to use them consistently and correctly for optimal results.

"Check those “lady lumps”! DO NOT sleep on breast cancer screening! 1 in 8 women will get breast cancer. 

Early detection and treatment is key. 

3 simple steps are:
1. breast self exam- at least once a month, about a week after your period (when breasts are less lumpy)
2. a physical exam by your doctor - most gyn visits will involve a routine breast exam 
3. breast imaging- mammogram +/- ultrasound (if breasts are dense) can start at 40 and be done annually. Some guidelines say to start later but I think it’s better to start screening at 40 and be proactive. 

If trying to get pregnant, do screening BEFORE you get pregnant. If you happen to find precancer or cancer your treatment options become very limited while pregnant- so make sure you have a clean bill of health before you get pregnant! 

If you have multiple family members with cancers, go see a cancer geneticist and consider cancer gene screening. If you find out you carry a gene mutation/variant and have a genetic predisposition to developing cancer, there are more rigorous screenings that can be done and even risk reducing medical and surgical strategies. ALSO- finding this out may prompt you to consider freezing eggs or embryos (as you could decide to do IVF now or later to test embryos for the gene and try to prevent passing it on to your children). Also there is some evidence that having the BRCA mutation can be associated with losing eggs at a faster rate. Some mutations like BRCA also predispose to ovarian cancer, so doing things like egg freezing before hand, just in case, is a smart thing to consider. 

Do you stay up to date on your GYN visits and use these strategies? If you don’t know, now ya knowww!

"I know how to do a lot of things, but I (and modern medicine) don’t know  how to make your ovaries have more eggs or how to retrieve/ovulate eggs with a better chance of turning into a normal embryo. WE DON’T KNOW. 

Ovarian PRP is experimental - injecting platelet-rich plasma into the cortex of the ovaries is invasive, expensive, and has not been shown to improve success rates. Egg quality diets and supplements have never been shown to significantly improve the number of eggs retrieved or live birth rates, in *well-designed, large studies*. 

You can cherry pick a study to prove a theory here and there- but the body of literature and data accumulated to date does not show that you can rejuvenate the ovaries. Hell, we don’t even have an individualized way to directly test ovarian reserve (egg count) yet! 

Now this does NOT mean there is not a role for healthy lifestyle, taking antioxidants, minimizing alcohol, not smoking etc in improving fertility. The data trends suggest these are all helpful- but we don’t necessarily know how.

I think that creating a healthy environment as eggs mature and get pushed through their developmental stages of meiosis (genetic reorganization) can maximize how your body responds to stimulation and how well the eggs do- but it won’t cancel out the factor we give the most weight: AGE. 

As we age, we lose eggs faster and have less available to retrieve (and a lower response) and the proteins that keep chromosomes in order (cohesin) breaks down which leads to more genetic imbalances in resulting embryos. 

We cannot rely on *magical* “ovarian rejuvenation” techniques - rather we should work to avoid toxic exposure (smoking) to not hasten ovarian aging and eat healthy (antioxidants) to protect where we can. And use proven strategies like egg/embryo freezing while younger to circumvent the limits of our biology!

PSA: Here’s some quick things to know about testing at home with urine pregnancy tests—

•Some are more sensitive than others- it may show up as negative/not pregnant if the pregnancy hormone (bhcg) is <25-50, depending on the brand you’re using. First Response is one of the more sensitive ones (can detect down to ~7)
•If you test too soon (<8 days after a transfer) or <2 weeks after ovulation (with trigger shot), you may get an erroneous reading (false negative if too soon after transfer, or even false positive if too soon (<2 weeks) after taking a trigger shot (which contains hcg). 
•Home urine pregnancy tests can be wrong or imprecise- so if you are taking medication (progesterone +/- estrogen) to support an early pregnancy, do not prematurely stop meds on the basis of a negative home test as it will not be as accurate as doing blood work with your clinic- always talk to your doctor/care team before making changes to your meds. 

99% of my patients who end up testing early at home tell me- sometimes they email me beforehand to let me know (and it makes me feel relieved too to be honest) — but I am always waiting for that more precise, definitive blood work result — and often will retest it within 48-72 hours to get >1 datapoint and see which direction things are going.

"Something I have learned about success (whether talking fertility treatment or life, in general) is that a huge part of it is just staying on the path and putting one foot in front of the other, trusting that it will eventually lead you to your destination. 

When I think of the number of journeys I have had the privilege to be a part of, I feel so inspired by every single patient - embarking on the road of TTC is a huge leap of faith. There are a lot of unknowns.

Something I have learned from guiding many patients through their journey is that nothing is ever a waste. 

We learn something from every failed cycle, every stumble, every setback - we learn and we get better. We evolve. We persist and overcome. 

If you are in the thick of it, please know that some way or another you will get to the “other side” aka a resolution.

"If you have thought about freezing your eggs, this video is for you! A large part of my practice is helping patients preserve their fertility - given the sheer volume and experience I have gained helping so many people freeze their eggs and come back to use them- I wanted to share a few important facts to know about egg freezing.

Since the experimental label on egg freezing was removed a decade ago, awareness has improved- with more people choosing to freeze their eggs and many having now used their frozen eggs as a back up plan to help them build their family. Coverage for egg freezing has improved as well! We looked at our egg freezing data from our large NYC based practice and found that a decade ago, ZERO egg freezing cycles were covered by insurance - whereas today ~50% of egg freezing cycles are covered. Access keeps improving thanks to  patients having amazing benefits like @progynyinc and organizations like @chickmission who provide egg freezing grants to women faced with a cancer diagnosis who have a medical need for fertility preservation prior to chemo, just to name a few major examples of progress.

"The success of egg freezing is strongly influenced by age and the effect it has on egg quality. Freezing eggs in your late 30s/early 40s and beyond can be successful but it is harder to know how many eggs to freeze and just how confident you can be- it is inportant to explore all fertility preservation options and really consider your fundamental priorities- is it more important to do whatever you can to have future children with your own eggs OR a future partner’s sperm? THAT is the real question that can help point you in the direction of the strategy that’s right for YOU.

"“When is it ‘safe’ to announce my pregnancy?”

There isn’t really a simple answer.
Reaching the milestone of sharing your pregnancy with your family, friends, and the world is a big one - especially if you have struggled to get pregnant and have undergone treatment!

There is no set time to share that you are pregnant. It depends on how comfortable you feel.

From a medical standpoint, most will base it on when they can feel confident the pregnancy is healthy and will continue and result in a live birth. We know that the majority of miscarriages occur in the first trimester. In general, this is 1 in 4 pregnancies - but the likelihood is higher at 38 and older. If you conceived via IVF and the embryo was genetically normal, the risk across the board drops to ~5-10% or less. In general, for all pregnancies- once a fetal heartbeat is beyond 7 wks, the probability of miscarriage is much lower (~10% or less). This is because many of the chromosomal imbalances that lead to miscarriage will not allow for a pregnancy to get to that point. 

At the end of the 1st tri, genetic testing can be done (screening via blood work/ultrasound and/or testing with chorionic villus sampling (CVS)). If normal + fetal growth and the heart rate continues to look good - many will feel comfortable with revealing that they are pregnant.

Some people wait til they can do an amniocentesis (another form of testing) in the 2nd tri. Even if genetic testing is normal, this does not exclude issues like birth defects (which can occur generally in any pregnancy 2-3%). Most birth defects or anomalies of internal organ development can be detected on an anatomy ultrasound scan from 18-22 weeks. 

Most people begin to ‘show’ and look pregnant at ~20+ weeks, so this is usually the latest that people will share.

Whenever you choose to share, just remember to be sensitive and to think about the audience receiving the message. You never know what people are going through. Also, you should never feel pressured to share your news earlier than you are comfortable. Do what feels right for you!"

"A complicated topic for a Saturday AM- but since I did not get to this week’s Q&A, I wanted to drop my thoughts about transferring mosaic embryos. 

Big takeaway: mosaic embryos are not all the same- things to know about a mosaic before considering transfer:
•is it low level or high level mosaic?
•what chromosome is involved? 
•do the abnormal cells in the mosaic embryo involve missing whole or just parts of a chromosome (aka segmental aneuploidy)

"Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)- what is it and how long does it (realistically) take to get pregnant? 

IUI is a procedure where a semen sample is collected and washed so that sperm is concentrated into a small volume which is then injected at the top of the uterus. From here, a high concentration of forward moving sperm enter the tubes on either side and (hopefully) interact with the egg(s). 

Whether doing IUI with your own ovulation or with an added boost from medications to potentially release more than one egg- IUI success rates aren’t so much higher than trying on your own with timed intercourse. IUIs are often used when conceiving using donor sperm. They can also provide an added edge when the sperm concentration or motility are a little lower than where we like to see, if there is sexual dysfunction and it’s hard to get sperm into the reproductive tract by having sex, or in unexplained infertility when we don’t know why it isn’t happening so maybe adding it in could help address some hidden factor. 

Because success rates tend to be anywhere from 5-15 (max 20%) each cycle, depending on the cycle/individual, it most often takes multiple IUIs to get pregnant. If you are choosing this as an option, get your head in the game that you may need 3-4 cycles at a minimum to realize a benefit. In couples with unexplained infertility, studies show cumulative success starts to level out and there are diminishing returns when you approach a 6th failed medicated IUI cycle. At this point, we usually call it and recommend moving onto IVF if possible. It is never wrong to switch from IUI to IVF earlier than the 6th cycle. But if you are motivated and want to see this method through- give it time. IUI may be less burdensome than IVF in some ways but it can certainly be a marathon- so mentally prepare for multiple cycles… and if it works earlier than expected, great- all you need is one ✨LUCKY ✨egg to meet the right sperm 💜

Have you done IUIs? What was your experience?

"I get asked this question all the time! 

IUI can be a great treatment option/first step- but one should never stay on the IUI path indefinitely without thinking about the big picture. Watch this video to learn my top 5 examples of reasons to consider moving on from IUI to IVF. 

Every case is different and every patient is an individual with their own goals and story. Here are 5 general reasons that I may encourage my patients to consider moving on from IUI to IVF. 

Please note that these are *NOT* rules or medical advice for you- but general thoughts I have re: the things to consider. It is important to be strategic with your treatment path as time = egg quantity and quality (which are both important for IVF efficiency and success! 

Not everyone who does IVF is successful and it’s not an easy or quick fix, and yes it is not always feasible or covered by insurance- and sometimes insurance will dictate how many IUIs you have to do before they will cover IVF. These are all real issues that have to be considered as well. 

Despite not being able to address these nuances, I hope this video is helpful in making people think critically about their strategy and if and when to pivot.

"Had to jump on this trend! But honestly - it is SO TRUE. We have to set the foundation of feeling proud of our bodies and not ashamed of our biology (ie. periods and all of the mental and physical changes and monthly signs and symptoms they come with!)

I talk to my 3 and 6 year old about periods. I let the convo come up organically. I use correct anatomical terms. I teach them about physical boundaries and to share their questions openly. Maybe they don’t understand all there is to know about ovulation and why periods happen (yet!) but the concept has been introduced early and will be discussed much more in years to come. 

As a fertility doctor, I believe it’s crucial to engage children early in conversations about reproductive health and periods. By discussing these topics openly and age-appropriately, we empower kids with accurate information, fostering a healthy understanding of their bodies. This knowledge encourages responsible decision-making and helps prevent misinformation. 

Early conversations also reduce stigma and anxiety around reproductive health matters, ensuring that kids grow up with confidence and respect for their bodies. 

Furthermore, addressing these subjects early can potentially identify any health concerns or irregularities sooner, allowing for timely intervention if needed. 

All too often, young women are labeled as “crazy” or “dramatic” or as “complainers” when they talk about their periods and the things they experience on a monthly basis. We need to normalize these convos so that people don’t feel gaslit by doctors, society, their partners etc. 

Overall, open discussions promote a positive attitude towards reproductive health and empower people  to take charge of their well-being later in life.

"Many of the patients I diagnose with PCOS on a daily basis, do NOT fit the ‘traditional’ mold when you think about the textbook picture associated with PCOS (which typically involves weight gain, especially abdominal, excess hair growth etc). 

PCOS is basically a communication issue - the brain is sending messages to the ovary but the ovary is resistant. Also the cells of the body are often resistant to insulin (which stores sugars). This leads to high insulin levels that can stimulate the ovary to make testosterone- which can further interfere with the signals from the brain to the ovary (worsening irregular cycles) and also cause acne and male-pattern hair growth. 

Weight gain can happen- this ties into the metabolic component of PCOS. However weight gain is NOT part of the diagnosis. You can be lean, normal weight, or even underweight and still have PCOS. 

There’s lots of confusion about the criteria for PCOS -but it actually doesn’t take much to be ruled in for the diagnosis (2 out of 3 of the following is enough: polycystic ovaries (crowded follicles), irregular cycles, symptoms or blood work suggestive of high androgen activity (testosterone)).

If someone is overweight and has PCOS and irregular cycles, losing weight can reduce insulin resistance and restore cycle regularity. 

While women with  lean PCOS do not need to lose weight or be restricted with their food consumption, they can still benefit from lifestyle changes and certain nutritional patterns. Even lean PCOS is associated with insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation. This is why the Mediterranean diet (which is antioxidant rich) is thought to help with inflammatory status, insulin resistance, and high androgens (like testosterone).  

Regular exercise and healthy lifestyle/diet (and drugs like metformin) can be helpful to reduce the symptoms (irregular cycles, acne, hair growth) in lean PCOS. 

If not TTC, acne/ hair growth may benefit from birth control (which lowers free testosterone activity), spironolactone (which lowers testosterone) + metformin (which lowers insulin levels, which in turns lowers ovarian testosterone production).

"Confession: I find watching those joint cracking videos oddly satisfying (and the algorithm knows it LOL)— perhaps because I have a chronic knuckle cracking habit! 

I have been asked about whether chiropractic adjustments can help with fertility and the answer is NO. 

There is a complete lack of scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment for infertility. Chiropractic care primarily focuses on the musculoskeletal system, particularly the spine, and claims to promote overall health by ensuring proper spinal alignment and nervous system function.

Infertility, on the other hand, can have various causes ranging from hormonal imbalances to structural issues within the reproductive organs. Chiropractic treatments are not considered a mainstream, primary approach for addressing infertility.

While some proponents of chiropractic care might claim that spinal adjustments can help improve reproductive function by ensuring optimal nerve flow and blood circulation to the reproductive organs, these claims are often anecdotal and lack robust scientific support. Research in this area is limited, and there is a lack of well-designed clinical studies to prove there is any link between chiropractic care and improved fertility outcomes.

Having said that, if you enjoy the feeling of your joints popping and find it relaxing - perhaps there could be some indirect benefit via stress relief/relaxation/placebo effect. I would caution against any manipulation of the thoracic-abdominal area of the body while pregnant and/or undergoing ovarian stimulation (as the ovaries are at risk of torsion due to becoming enlarged). And I would NEVER recommend *relying* on a chiropractic methods for the treatment of infertility- talk to your OBGYN and/or a board certified Reproductive Endocrinologist & Infertility specialist.

"As a follow up to my last post on PCOS- here are some quick facts you should know! 

Whether #ttc or not it is important to know that there are ways to address the signs and symptoms of PCOS.

Irregular cycles/ovulation can be treated directly with medications such as letrozole (or clomid/gonadotropins). If treating- I recommend making sure everything else is in “working order” aka total motile sperm count >10 million, unblocked tube(s), normal uterine cavity etc. to make sure it makes sense - and that IVF is not the better plan. 

Reducing insulin resistance can help with fertility and also general health. This can be achieved with weightloss, lifestyle (diet and exercise), and drugs like metformin, supplements such as inositol (weak evidence). 

Quality of life issues like acne and hirsutism (excess hair growth) can be treated with targeted therapies (oral birth control pills, anti androgen therapies such as spironolactone, topical antibiotics, laser/electrolysis etc. 

An important PSA is to make sure you don’t allow an unhealthy buildup of uterine lining that doesn’t get shed for >90 days a time (it is important to balance the lining with progesterone either from ovulation or from supplementation)- otherwise, these built up uterine lining cells can transform to precancer or cancerous cells. An easy way to “protect” the lining is to use birth control pills that contain progesterone, a progestin IUD, or taking cyclic progesterone to shed the lining. 

Did you know women with PCOS are more people to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression? 

There are many aspects about PCOS to manage- find an expert who can help you focus on ALL areas to improve your quality of life and overall health.

Can’t a fertility doctor just come home and unwind in front of the tv after a long day?!? 🤣🤪

Newsflash: nobody can tell if your baby was born from IVF, IUI, or without treatment…the same way they can’t tell if the baby was born vaginally or via c-section! 

Let’s please stop saying: “conceived naturally” or “delivered naturally”!!! 💜

When it comes to reproductive health, I’ve removed the word “natural” from my vocabulary and you should too. 

There is no such thing as a natural conception, a natural delivery, a natural family…

"Quintuplet headlines are not success stories. Yes it seems miraculous to go from having no kids to 5 kids overnight - but twin and especially higher order multiple pregnancies are never the goal of fertility treatment- they are actually viewed as a risk/complication. 

Nowadays, the risk of having twins, and especially triplets or even higher order pregnancies, is significantly lower from fertility treatment thanks to many clinics being able to adapt a Single Embryo Transfer (SET) approach (due to improved IVF success rates). Embryos can split 2-3% of the time (a not so common occurrence). Another mechanism for twins is using medication to induce ovulation (with timed intercourse or IUI)- if using oral meds like clomid or letrozole the risk is lower (3-8% depending on age, # follicles that become mature) … using injectable medications (FSH, menopur etc) can be associated with a much higher risk.

Why is this important?
Multifetal pregnancy has a much higher risk of preterm delivery. As the older sister of a preemie (25 weeker) who needed oxygen therapy for the first 5 years of life (my mom didn’t have twins but went into preterm labor), and as an OBGYN, I am no stranger to the myriad of complications that can arise from being premature: ie. lung under development, vision issues, brain bleeds, neurological issues etc etc. 

This all sounds scary- but know that the risk of these complications can be minimized with careful planning and decision making. This is why I think mid cycle ultrasound monitoring is so important when using medication to induce ovulation + knowing when to cancel a cycle. 
When using donor egg IVF or genetically tested normal embryos, I always recommend a single embryo transfer to lower the risk of twins!

"Would you ever have a sperm donor selection party with your family?!? (I think the little sperm confetti was a nice touch, btw 🤣). 

When looking for a sperm donor, the decision should be based on a combination of medical criteria and your personal preferences… maybe influenced by what your aunts and uncles think?! 😬

Regardless of whether this is a solo or group decision, here’s what you should consider:
1. Medical History:  Of the donor and their family to assess potential genetic risks. 
2. Genetic Compatibility: Genetic carrier screening will identify mutations you carry - to weed out donors who carry the same mutations (to reduce the risk of a child with medical problems).
3. CMV immunity: If you are non-immune, it is wise to choose a CMV negative donor to avoid the risk of CMV infection during pregnancy.
4. Donor’s Profile: physical traits, education, occupation, and interests.
5. Health and Lifestyle: overall health, lifestyle choices, and habits.
6. Fertility and Success Rates: donor’s fertility and success rates, including the number of pregnancies resulting from their donations.
7. Legal Considerations: the legal rights and responsibilities associated with sperm donation, such as parental rights and future contact agreements.
8. Donor Anonymity: Decide whether you prefer an anonymous or open donor. An open donor may allow contact with the child later in life, providing potential information and a sense of identity (also be aware that ‘anonymous’ is a misnomer nowadays in the world of 23&me and DTC genetic testing).
9. Donor Screening Process: screening procedures conducted by the sperm bank or clinic (ie. testing for infectious diseases and genetic disorders). 
10. Sperm Bank Reputation: Choose a reputable and accredited sperm bank or clinic. 
11. Emotional Support: Consider seeking counseling or support groups to help you navigate the emotional aspects of donor conception.

Remember to consult with medical professionals, fertility specialists, and legal experts to ensure your decisions align with your specific circumstances and goals.

"I wish I was more diligent about noting when my cycle starts (aka day 1 or the first day of the Last Menstrual Period (LMP))- but I will admit it often slips my mind!! 

There are many benefits to tracking your #menstrualcycle and how you feel emotionally and physically throughout. 

Reasons to keep track of your menstrual cycle:
1. **Fertility Awareness:** Monitoring your #period provides insights into your most fertile days, helping you identify the optimal window for conception if you’re trying to get pregnant.

2. **Health Monitoring:** Irregularities in your cycle length, flow, or symptoms could indicate underlying health issues such as polycystic ovary syndrome #pcos or thyroid problems. Early detection through tracking enables timely medical intervention.

3. **Effective Contraception:** Understanding your cycle enhances the accuracy of natural contraceptive methods, allowing you to avoid unprotected intercourse during your #fertilewindow 

4. **Menstrual Health:** Tracking helps you monitor changes in cycle patterns, flow, and symptoms, which aids in recognizing potential concerns such as abnormal bleeding (ie. fibroids, adenomyosis) or painful periods (ie. endometriosis).

5. **Personal Empowerment:** By gaining a deeper understanding of your body’s natural rhythms, you become more in tune with your overall health and wellbeing, enabling informed decisions about fertility, pregnancy planning, and self-care. Cycle synching is a real thing- knowing that in your follicular phase (between menstruation and ovulation) you will have more energy and endurance versus your luteal phase (post ovulation until menstruation) where progesterone can have a relaxing effect on your body (your muscles, joints, nervous/gastrointestinal system etc). This helps people plan what types of work outs to do to optimize and harness their menstrual cycle. Personally, I try to avoid any important deadlines/meetings in the week before my period (due to being more prone to feeling anxious/migraines).

Consistent menstrual cycle tracking empowers women to take control of their #reproductivehealth , optimize #fertility & #ttc , and address potential health issues proactively."
"I feel strongly that everyone with ovaries should KNOW about reproductive aging and the OPTION to freeze eggs/embryos to preserve their fertility. And I hope that insurance coverage for fertility preservation continues to expand so everyone has access! 

I think it is great that @brynn_whitfield of @rhonybravo is talking about this and raising awareness.

"If @bravotv is looking for a new show- I think “The Realest Fertility Clinic in New York” would be 🔥
Who’s with me?!

I’m ready! 🎥🤳🏽📸

Team work makes the dream work ✨🙌🏽💜
When you walk into our clinic @rmaofny - expect to see more than just a doctor.
We work with an incredible team of caring individuals who help with every aspect of your care. Navigating fertility testing and treatment is hard enough- getting quality care and guidance shouldn’t be. Here are some key players in a fertility clinic (and this doesn’t include the lab/embryology because that’s a whole separate reel!)

The doctor takes your history, does a physical exam/ultrasound, discusses testing and forms a treatment plan, monitors throughout treatment and hopefully (very soon) does your pregnancy monitoring before discharging to your OB at around 8-9 weeks. I definitely cannot do my job without having a strong team to support me and the patients! 

Nursing- they administer medications, can come to your home to help with injections, answer questions via phone/email and give med instructions and provide overall guidance and support.

Fertility Care Coordinators- well, they coordinate your entire cycle, order meds, make you a schedule and are a major source of support throughout- they are logistics people! 

The front desk/admin- they get you on the schedule and help with getting medical records from you, providing letters and reducing the pesky paperwork that can bog you down in getting set up.

Phlebotomy- they draw your labs and help set up testing and procedures. 

Clinical assistants- chaperone exams/scans and assist the doctor with diagnostic procedures. 

Finance- will give you transparency on what things will cost and how to use your insurance plan to cover and we also fight tooth and nail to get whatever we can covered 💪🏽

We are a team that works together to get you to your goal- with zero drama 😉✨💜

"Cycle syncing, also known as menstrual cycle syncing or hormonal syncing, is a concept that involves aligning various aspects of your life with your menstrual cycle to optimize your physical and emotional well-being. This might sound obvious- but I think I have spent most of my life working AGAINST what my body wants to do and not being as strategic as I could’ve been. Since using cycle synching it feels like I have gained a super power. I do certain work outs during certain phases and schedule deadlines strategically!

Our hormones fluctuate throughout our menstrual cycle, different activities and self-care practices may be more beneficial at different times. This is a REAL reproductive health hack! 

Here are some general guidelines for planning around your menstrual cycle:

1. Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5):
 - Focus on self-care, rest, and relaxation.
 - Light to moderate exercise is usually best.

2. Follicular Phase (Days 6-14):
 - Energy and creativity typically increase.
 - Plan challenging tasks and workouts.
 - Socialize and engage in new projects.

3. Ovulatory Phase (Days 14-16):
 - Peak energy and confidence levels.
 - Ideal time for important meetings or presentations.

4. Luteal Phase (Days 17-28):
 - May experience mood swings and fatigue.
 - Prioritize self-care, stress management, and sleep.
 - Gentle exercise like yoga or walking can be beneficial.
 - Healthy comfort foods and balanced nutrition are important.

To get started with cycle syncing track your menstrual cycle: Use a period tracking app or journal to monitor your cycle’s length and symptoms. Identify your unique patterns: Pay attention to how your body and mood change throughout your cycle. Everyone’s experience is different. Tailor your schedule and activities to align with your energy levels, mood, and physical symptoms during each phase of your cycle. Modify your workout routine to match your energy levels and physical comfort during different phases.

Remember that cycle syncing is a personal approach, and what works best for one person may not work the same way for another. It’s essential to listen to your body and adapt your lifestyle accordingly."
"I love seeing these women spill the tea on egg/embryo freezing for fertility preservation (as I drink my mine ☺️☕️ )!! Sharing openly and normalizing the conversation about fertility preservation is so important! 

The latest episode of @rhonybravo tackled common questions I get like “how does it ACTUALLY feel to go through the process of egg retrieval?” and “Is it better to freeze eggs or embryos?”. It definitely raised some misconceptions too 🤨👀…

"Endometriosis is a common condition that can (but does not always) cause fertility issues. Avg time to diagnosis: 10 years!😲🤯

The hallmark sign is painful periods. Endometriosis and regular menstrual cramps have some similarities in symptoms, but there are some key differences:

1. Severity and Duration:
 - Menstrual cramps are mild to moderate and last for a few days.
 - Endometriosis-associated pain can be severe and may last throughout your menstrual cycle, not just during your period.

2. Location of Pain:
 - Menstrual cramps are usually felt in the lower abdomen or pelvis.
 - Endometriosis pain can be more widespread and may also radiate to the lower back and even down the legs.
-It can present as pain with urination/defecation/deep penetration during sex or even painful rectal spasms. 

3. Timing of Pain:
 - Menstrual cramps usually occur shortly before or during your period.
 - Endometriosis-related pain can occur at any time during your menstrual cycle and may worsen around your period.

4. Other Symptoms:
 - Endometriosis can cause additional symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding, pain during intercourse, bowel or urinary issues, and infertility. These are less common with regular menstrual cramps.

5. Response to Pain Medication:
 - Menstrual cramps often respond well to over-the-counter pain relievers (e.g., ibuprofen).
 - Endometriosis pain may not always respond adequately to over-the-counter medications and might require stronger prescription medications. It can be pain that interferes with your daily ability to function/attend school/work. 

If you suspect you have endometriosis or are experiencing severe pain, it’s important to consult with a doctor. They can perform a physical examination, order imaging tests, or recommend pain relief, meds to stop ovulation- and if that doesn’t help- a laparoscopy (a surgical procedure) to formally diagnose and differentiate between menstrual cramps and endometriosis. Early diagnosis and treatment can help manage the symptoms of endometriosis effectively. 

Not everyone needs surgery to diagnose. If meds treat/suppress endometriosis - that is often a clear sign/good first step to treat."
"It’s Saturday… so I thought I should keep the vibes high and remind you that your uterus doesn’t age. 

Yes your eggs do- but we can extract and hold em’ at -196 degrees Celsius in liquid nitrogen to prevent further aging. There are many studies showing that when age of the eggs is controlled/constant - the age of the person (and their uterus) undergoing the embryo transfer does not influence odds of success. 

Even if you have to get your ovaries removed surgically or go into menopause, we can still get you pregnant with previously frozen eggs/embryos or donor eggs by giving you the hormones needed to support an early implanting embryo/pregnancy until the placenta takes over at 7-10 weeks of pregnancy.

"There are so many reasons to use an egg donor! 
Here are twelve potential reasons someone might choose to use an egg donor:

1. Infertility: When a person or couple is unable to produce viable eggs due to infertility issues.

2. Age-related infertility: As women age, egg quality and quantity can decline, leading to difficulty conceiving.

3. Genetic disorders: If there’s a risk of passing on hereditary conditions, using donor eggs can help avoid this risk.

4. Recurrent miscarriages: Women who have experienced multiple miscarriages may turn to egg donation for a higher chance of a successful pregnancy.

5. Premature ovarian failure: In cases where the ovaries stop functioning prematurely, donor eggs can provide an alternative.

6. Poor egg quality: Some individuals may have eggs with poor quality, making it challenging to conceive.

7. Absence of ovaries: People born without ovaries or who have had them removed may opt for egg donation.

8. Cancer treatment: Certain cancer treatments can harm ovarian function, making donor eggs a viable option after treatment.

9. LGBTQ+ parenting: Same-sex couples or single LGBTQ+ individuals may choose egg donation or need it to build their families.

10. Unsuccessful IVF attempts: After multiple failed IVF cycles using their own eggs, some may try donor eggs for better success rates.

11. Desire for genetic connection: Some individuals may want to carry a pregnancy but need donor eggs to do so while still having a genetic link through sperm.

12. Personal choice: Regardless of medical reasons, some people may prefer using donor eggs for various personal or lifestyle reasons.

Always find a good doctor you feel comfortable with to help you consider your unique circumstances when making this important decision! 

There are so many reasons why people use donor eggs- shouldn’t we be talking about it more?
