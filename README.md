# BlueLabel AI Cookbook
This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks created by the [BlueLabel](https://bluelabellabs.com) engineering team that demonstrate how to use LLM and their associated APIs to create tools powered by Generative AI. The tools demonstrated in this cookbook are done in the form of Jupyter notebooks. 

Each folder in the repository represents a separate tool and within it you will find a README.md file describing its purpose and how to run it. While this cookbook only contains Jupyter notebooks, some of these tools also have their own source code repositories where the complete source code for them can be found.

## Instagram Post Classifier
Demonstrates how to classify a large data set of Instagram post captions into a set of normalized, unique topics.

## Instagram Reel -> YouTube Short Title Converter
Demonstrates how to use GPT with Langchain to take Instagram post captions and create snappy YouTube Short Titles that are engaging and also relevant to the content it is trying to describe.

## AutoTweeter
The [AutoTweeter](https://github.com/bll-bobbygill/bll-ai-cookbook/tree/main/auto-tweeter) notebook demonstrates how to use ChatGPT, LangChain, and Reddit to fully automate research and creation of content for a user's Twitter feed.

## App Store Connect Metadata Generator
The [App Store Connect Metadata Generator](https://github.com/bll-bobbygill/bll-ai-cookbook/tree/main/appstore-connect-info-generator) demonstrates how to use LangChain and ChatGPT to automate the creation of a full set of Apple App Store metadata when simply given a name, category and functionality.

## WhatsApp Chat Analysis
The [WhatsApp Chat Analysis](https://github.com/bll-bobbygill/bll-ai-cookbook/tree/main/whatsapp-chat-analysis) project shows how LangChain can be used to ingest a WhatsApp chat history and use that history to generate responses to new messages in the same tone as the sender of messages in the history.
